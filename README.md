## Aim of the project
This project aims to simulate an emergency medical response scenario in the challenging terrain of Righi,
located in Genoa, Italy. The scenario involves a smart ambulance equipped with a drone, designed to deliver
life-saving medicines to a patient in an inaccessible area. The simulation will be developed using Unreal
Engine, Cesium, Airsim, QGroundControl, PX4, and Python APIs, ROS , D-Flight to create a realistic and
interactive environment for testing and validating the systemâ€™s capabilities.
